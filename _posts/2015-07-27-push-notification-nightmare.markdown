When I was young, my worst nightmare consist of monster and ghost. But now I experience my worst nightmare.

I am stuck.

Stuck with a never ending hell.

Everyday is a torture, nothing to learn, nothing is new.

When I stare a my laptop, there is only one project on my screen. Although the screen is filled with numerous lines of code, I can only see emptiness, void and sorrows. Everyday I am fixing the bug that I have no part in, the one who held responsible to it, he left the team go on with his new project.

Stuck with people with no insight, stuck with a company with no creativity and don't see any hardworking people, but *talkative* people. They talk, and takes no action. All the hard work is done by others.

Surrounded by laziness.

This is a cocoon.

I have to leave, or I will die with it.
