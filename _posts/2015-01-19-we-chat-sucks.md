Fuck WeChat
---
I work on a project recently, the client needs a share function that link with WeChat.

"WeChat SDK iOS" => Google search

1. WeChat Developer Center
2. WeChat Open platform
3. WeChat Open ID

What? Which one should I use? What!!!???

Complicated

After some researching, the WeChat Open platform is the way to go. Okay, the next thing to get is AppID.

You think that is simple?? You have to verified every thing: your address(why?), phone number(why?), app bundle id (?), ...etc, before you can hit the "Create New Application" button.

Last time I link an app with a social network (tumblr), I just add an application and **BOOM** done.

Restrictive

Share a photo with description and title? Simple? NO! This useless SDK won't let you do it.

This fucking SDK only let you share ONE fucking photo when a pathetic title.

The worst part is when I try the WeChat app on iOS, it can share MULTIPLE PHOTOS with DESCRIBTIONS!!!!!!

Good job WeChat, GOOD JOB.
